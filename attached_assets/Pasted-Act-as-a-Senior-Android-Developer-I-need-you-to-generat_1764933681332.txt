Act as a Senior Android Developer. I need you to generate a complete, functional code structure for a native Android application using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. The app is a minimalist "Quiz/Test Maker".

**Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
**Local Storage:** Room Database
**UI:** Jetpack Compose (Material Design 3)

### Core Concept
The app allows users to create their own custom tests (quizzes), run them, track their history, and maintain a daily streak.

### Data Models & Database
1.  **Quiz:** ID, title, description, creationDate.
2.  **Question:** ID, quizId, questionText, **orderIndex (Int)**.
3.  **Answer:** ID, questionId, answerText, isCorrect (Boolean).
4.  **QuizRun (History):** ID, quizId, timestamp, scorePercentage, totalQuestions, correctCount, wrongCount.

### Key Features & Requirements

**1. Main Navigation (Bottom Bar)**
* **Tab 1: Tests (Library):** List of all created tests. FAB (Floating Action Button) to create a new test.
* **Tab 2: History:** List of completed test runs.
* **Top Bar (Global):**
    * **Streak Counter:** Displays current streak (e.g., "🔥 5"). Logic: Increments if a test is completed between 00:00-23:59 (calendar day). Resets to 0 if a day is skipped.
    * **Settings Icon:** Opens the settings screen.

**2. Create/Edit Test Mode**
* User can add/edit/delete Questions.
* **Reordering:** User must be able to **manually reorder questions** (e.g., via Drag & Drop or Up/Down arrows) to define a specific sequence. This sequence is saved to the `orderIndex`.
* User can add multiple Answers to a Question and mark one as correct.
* User can save the Test.

**3. Active Quiz Mode (The "Run")**
* **Pre-start:** Option to toggle "Timer" (count up or count down) and "Shuffle Questions".
* **UI:** Minimalist. Question text, list of answer buttons. Top bar has a "X" to quit.
* **Logic:**
    * **If Shuffle is ON:** Randomize question order.
    * **If Shuffle is OFF:** Respect the manual `orderIndex` defined in the editor.
    * **Instant Feedback:** When user taps an answer, immediately show Green (Correct) or Red (Wrong).
    * Wait for a brief delay or user tap, then move to the next question.
* **Completion:** Calculate % score.
* **Post-Quiz Screen:**
    * Show Score, Correct/Wrong counts.
    * **Action:** "Review Mistakes" (See list of wrong questions).
    * **Action:** "Retry Mistakes" (Start a mini-run with ONLY wrong questions). **Crucial:** These "mini-runs" do NOT save to History and do not affect stats.
    * Save the main run to the Room Database.

**4. History Section**
* List of all past `QuizRun` items.
* **Filter:** Allow user to filter history by a specific `Quiz` to see progress on that specific topic.
* Clicking a history item shows details (which questions were wrong).
* Ability to "Retry Mistakes" from here as well (does not save to history).

**5. Settings Screen**
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle app theme.
* **Default Shuffle:** Toggle (sets the default state for new runs).
* **Sound Effects:** Volume slider (for correct/wrong feedback sounds).

### Technical constraints
* Use `DataStore` or `SharedPreferences` for the Streak and Settings.
* Use `ViewModel` to handle logic.
* Handle empty states (e.g., "No tests created yet").

**Deliverables:**
Please provide the code for:
1.  **Room Entities & DAO** (Ensure `Question` has an ordering field).
2.  **Main ViewModel** (Handling the quiz logic, reordering logic, streak, and database ops).
3.  **Compose UI Screens** (Main scaffold, Quiz Editor with reordering, Quiz Screen, Result Screen).

Start by outlining the folder structure and dependencies, then provide the code.
